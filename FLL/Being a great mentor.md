This document contains a list of “how to be a great mentor” topics that we’ve been over with the student mentors, and ones that we would like to go over, just so we have a record for the future.


Topics discussed:

Oct 1st:
- “Teaching through listening”
- Not being afraid to say “I don’t know, but I’ll help you find out”
- Reinforces that it’s OK not to know all the answers (and nobody does)
- Role models how to find out the information
- Helps teach the student how to find answers for themselves


Oct 8th:
- Make an effort to learn names, it make the kids feel valued.


Oct 15th:
- After pushing information to a student lecture-style, always ask a question that gets them to echo it back to you, it forces them to process and internalize it.
“The more they talk about it, the more they clarify their thinking and gain confidence” -- Carmen Bowles
- If you ask a echoing question and there’s silence, a good trick is “Turn and talk to your neighbour”.
- Student mentors should try to work with the same students, rather than hopping from group-to-group (for a whole meeting, and from week to week). The kids are shy and take a while to open up to a person.


Nov 19th:
- We need to be role-models of calm, collected teamwork. This A) helps teach them the skills, and B) helps us calm them down when they get stressed or upset.


Topics we could discuss:
- Being aware of students looking alone or stumped … Go over and sit with them!
- Body language - how to be approachable
- Your smile, tone of voice, posture, etc. can say “I welcome questions” or “leave me alone!”
- Bend down and meet them at their eye level - reduces barriers and shows you’re interested in what they have to say
